                Research Architecture Programs: Start by researching and
                identifying accredited architecture programs. Look for
                universities or colleges that offer Bachelor of Architecture
                (B.Arch.) or Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degrees. Consider
                factors such as the program's reputation, curriculum, faculty,
                and resources.
